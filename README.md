## Data Sources

All data was scraped from archived snapshots of [WoWProgramming.com](https://web.archive.org/web/2010/http://wowprogramming.com/docs) (pre-Cataclysm, before October 12, 2010) and supplemented with data from [Warcraft Wiki](https://warcraft.wiki.gg) and [Wowpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com). Memory addresses and internal function mappings were obtained through reverse engineering of the WoW 3.3.5a client (build 12340). No external API calls are made at runtime — everything is statically bundled.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's fixing a typo, improving a description, or adding undocumented API details — every contribution helps make this reference better for the whole 3.3.5a modding community.

### Verification Badges

Every function and event entry displays a verification badge. This status is **computed automatically** from the data — there is no manual flag to set.

| Badge | Criteria | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Verified** (green) | Real description + memory address in binary OR documentation from a pre-Cataclysm archive snapshot (before Oct 12, 2010) | Confirmed WotLK 3.3.5a information |
| **To review** (orange) | Real description but documentation URL points to a post-WotLK snapshot | Info exists but may differ from the 3.3.5a version |
| **Unverified** (red) | No description or "No documentation available." | Needs community contribution |

### How to Improve an Entry's Status

**Unverified → Verified:**
1. Add a real description to the entry in the corresponding `src/data/*.ts` file
2. Set the `documentationUrl` field to a pre-Cataclysm Wayback Machine snapshot (timestamp before `20101012`)
3. Example: `https://web.archive.org/web/20100701213739/http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api/FunctionName`

**To review → Verified:**
1. Find a pre-Cataclysm snapshot of the same page on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org)
2. Update `documentationUrl` to use the earlier timestamp
3. Verify the description matches the pre-Cataclysm content

**Adding a memory address** (functions only):
- If you have reverse-engineered WoW.exe build 12340, add the `memoryAddress` field (e.g. `"0x004A2F30"`)
- A function with a memory address + real description is automatically **Verified**, even without a documentation URL

### Data Files

All reference data is in `src/data/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `api-functions.ts` | Game API functions (Lua) |
| `events.ts` | Game events |
| `widgets.ts` | UI widget types and methods |
| `data-types.ts` | Enums, flags, and types |
| `cvars.ts` | Console variables |
| `secure-templates.ts` | Secure frame templates |
