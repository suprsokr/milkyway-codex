## Data Sources

The primary source is the *World of Warcraft Programming* book (2nd Edition), the definitive WotLK 3.3.5a reference. This was supplemented by scraping pre-Cataclysm snapshots of [WoWProgramming.com](https://web.archive.org/web/2010/http://wowprogramming.com/docs) from the Wayback Machine (before October 12, 2010). Memory addresses and internal function mappings were obtained through reverse engineering of the WoW 3.3.5a client (build 12340). No external API calls are made at runtime — everything is statically bundled.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Visit the [Contribute page](https://milkyway-codex.vercel.app/contribute) to see entries that need documentation or verification.

### Verification Badges

Every function, event, and widget entry displays a verification badge. This status is **computed automatically** from the data — there is no manual flag to set.

| Badge | Criteria | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Verified** (green) | Has a `bookPage` reference (from the WoW Programming book), OR memory address in binary + pre-Cata archive docs, OR pre-Cata archive docs alone | Confirmed WotLK 3.3.5a information |
| **To review** (orange) | Real description but documentation URL points to a post-WotLK snapshot | Info exists but may differ from the 3.3.5a version |
| **Unverified** (red) | No description or "No documentation available." | Needs community contribution |

### How to Improve an Entry's Status

**Unverified → Verified:**
1. Add a real description to the entry in the corresponding `src/data/*.ts` file
2. Set the `documentationUrl` field to a pre-Cataclysm Wayback Machine snapshot (timestamp before `20101012`)
3. Example: `https://web.archive.org/web/20100701213739/http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api/FunctionName`

**To review → Verified:**
1. Find a pre-Cataclysm snapshot of the same page on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org)
2. Update `documentationUrl` to use the earlier timestamp
3. Verify the description matches the pre-Cataclysm content

**Adding a memory address** (functions only):
- If you have reverse-engineered WoW.exe build 12340, add the `memoryAddress` field (e.g. `"0x004A2F30"`)
- A function with a memory address + real description is automatically **Verified**, even without a documentation URL

**Adding a book page reference:**
- If you can find the entry in the *WoW Programming* book (2nd Edition), add the `bookPage` field with the page number
- Any entry with a `bookPage` is automatically **Verified**

### Data Files

All reference data is in `src/data/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `api-functions.ts` | Game API functions (Lua) |
| `events.ts` | Game events |
| `widgets.ts` | UI widget types and methods |
| `data-types.ts` | Enums, flags, and types |
| `cvars.ts` | Console variables |
| `combat-log-events.ts` | Combat log sub-events |
| `secure-templates.ts` | Secure frame templates |
